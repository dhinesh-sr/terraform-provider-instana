# Custom Event Specification with Entity Verification Rule Resource

Configuration of a custom event specification based on an entity verification rule. This rule type is used
to check for hosts which do not have matching entities running on them.

API Documentation: <https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/putCustomEventSpecification>

`default_name_prefix` and `default_name_prefix` is **NOT** supported for this resource as this feature will
be removed in version 2.x.

## Example Usage

### Entity Verification Rule

```hcl
resource "instana_custom_event_specification" "example" {
  name            = "name"
  description     = "description"
  enabled         = true
  triggering      = true
  expiration_time = 60000
  entity_type     = "instanaAgent"

  rules {  
    entity_count {
      severity           = "warning"
      condition_operator = "="
      condition_value    = 100
    }
  } 
}
```

### Entity Count Verification Rule

```hcl
resource "instana_custom_event_specification" "example" {
  name            = "name"
  description     = "description"
  query           = "query"
  enabled         = true
  triggering      = true
  expiration_time = 60000
  entity_type     = "host"

  rules {  
    entity_count_verification {
      severity              = "warning"
      matching_entity_type  = "process"
      matching_operator     = "is"
      matching_entity_label = "entity-label"
      offline_duration      = 60000
      condition_operator    = "="
      condition_value       = 10
    }
  } 
}
```

### Entity Verification Rule

```hcl
resource "instana_custom_event_specification" "example" {
  name            = "name"
  description     = "description"
  query           = "query"
  enabled         = true
  triggering      = true
  expiration_time = 60000
  entity_type     = "host"

  rules {  
    entity_verification {
      severity              = "warning"
      matching_entity_type  = "process"
      matching_operator     = "is"
      matching_entity_label = "entity-label"
      offline_duration      = 60000
    }
  } 
}
```

### Host Availability Rule

#### To scope hosts by Tag, set tag_filter like following. 

```hcl
resource "instana_custom_event_specification" "example" {
  name            = "name"
  description     = "description"
  enabled         = true
  triggering      = true
  expiration_time = 60000
  entity_type     = "host"

  rules {  
    host_availability {
      severity         = "warning"
      offline_duration = 60000
      close_after      = 120000
      tag_filter       = "tag@na EQUALS 'foo_bar'"
    }
  } 
}
```

#### To scope all hosts (All available entities), skip passing tag_filter. 

```hcl
resource "instana_custom_event_specification" "example" {
  name            = "Host offline"
  description     = "Host offline"
  enabled         = true
  triggering      = true
  expiration_time = 60000
  entity_type     = "host"

  rules {  
    host_availability {
      severity         = "critical"
      offline_duration = 60000
      close_after      = 120000
    }
  } 
}
```

### System Rule

```hcl
resource "instana_custom_event_specification" "example" {
  name            = "name"
  description     = "description"
  query           = "query"
  enabled         = true
  triggering      = true
  expiration_time = 60000
  entity_type     = "any"

  rules { 
    system {
      severity       = "warning"
      system_rule_id = "system-rule-id"
    }
  } 
}
```

### Threshold Rule

#### Single Threshold Rule

```hcl
resource "instana_custom_event_specification" "example" {
  name            = "name"
  description     = "description"
  query           = "query"
  enabled         = true
  triggering      = true
  expiration_time = 60000
  entity_type     = "nomadScheduler"

  rules { 
    threshold {
      severity           = "critical"
      metric_name        = "nomad.client.allocations.pending"
      window             = 60000
      aggregation        = "avg"
      condition_operator = ">"
      condition_value    = 0
    }
  } 
}
```

#### Multiple Threshold Rule

```hcl
resource "instana_custom_event_specification" "example" {
  name            = "name"
  description     = "description"
  query           = "query"
  enabled         = true
  triggering      = true
  expiration_time = 60000
  entity_type     = "nomadScheduler"

  rule_logical_operator = "OR"
  
  rules { 
    threshold {
      severity           = "critical"
      metric_name        = "nomad.client.allocations.blocked"
      window             = 60000
      aggregation        = "avg"
      condition_operator = ">"
      condition_value    = 0
    }
    
    threshold {
      severity           = "critical"
      metric_name        = "nomad.client.allocations.pending"
      window             = 60000
      aggregation        = "avg"
      condition_operator = ">"
      condition_value    = 0
    }
  } 
}
```
